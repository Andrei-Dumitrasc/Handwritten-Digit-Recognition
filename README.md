# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Comparison and compatibility study concerning image preprocessing techniques and recognition algorithms.

Implementation of algorithms: 
* Nearest-Neighbour: 1 and k
* Projection: EigenFaces, Customized Orthogonalization via Deflation, Lanczos
* Small neural network (TensorFlow tutorial)

Preprocessed image types:
* negative
* binary
* blurred
* sharpened
* gamma corrected
* cropped

Additionally considered: norms/distances (L1 or L2) and pixel format (integer or real).
